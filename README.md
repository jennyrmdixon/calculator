# Calculator
This calculator app is a project I completed as part of [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/foundations-calculator) curriculum. The purpose of this project was to practice my JavaScript skills and improve my understanding of web development by building a fully functional calculator with basic mathematical operations (add, subtract, multiple, and divide).
